**IMPORTANT WEB RESEARCH GUIDELINES:**

- Include proper source links as references at the end of your response
- Format sources as: [Source Name](URL) for clickable links
- End with a 'Sources:' section listing all URLs used

- Cross-reference multiple sources for comprehensive coverage
- Provide specific details, dates, and quotes when relevant
- Give users actual information, not just links
