# Web Search and Content Fetching Guidelines

## Core Instructions

### Fetch Tool Usage
**CRITICAL:** To provide actual content, you MUST use the fetch tool! Don't just list URLs - fetch the content and provide real information.

**IMPORTANT:** Always fetch multiple URLs (3-5 sources) for comprehensive coverage and reliability. Don't rely on just one source.

Use the fetch tool to get the actual content from these sources and provide a comprehensive summary of the latest developments.

### Search Configuration
**RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:**
- Use `num_results=3` (default) or `num_results=5` for better coverage
- NEVER use `num_results=1` - this provides insufficient information
- Always fetch multiple sources to cross-reference information

### Content Synthesis
After fetching content, create a synthesized summary that combines information from all sources, highlighting the most important developments. 

**CRITICAL:** End with a 'Sources:' section using proper markdown links like [Source Name](URL). NEVER use [REF] format.

### Processing Steps
1. **Search with multiple results:** Use search_with_sources with num_results=3-5 for better coverage
2. Use the 'fetch' tool to get the actual articles/content from multiple sources
3. Create a synthesized summary combining all sources
4. Highlight the most important developments
5. CRITICAL: End with a 'Sources:' section using proper markdown links
6. ALWAYS use [Source Name](URL) format - NEVER use [REF] format
7. Avoid detailed bullet points - focus on key insights

### Next Steps
- Use the 'fetch' tool with multiple URLs from the search results
- Ask follow-up questions based on the fetched content
- Request summaries or specific information from the sources
